# OmniMemEval integration

OmniMemEval is NMG's preferred upstream harness for public user-memory
benchmarks. It already runs LongMemEval, LoCoMo, BEAM, PersonaMem v2 and
HaluMem through a shared lifecycle:

```text
benchmark data
  -> add(messages, user_id)
  -> memory backend
  -> search(query, user_id, top_k)
  -> answer model
  -> official/dataset scorer
  -> report
```

## Integration boundary

NMG should contribute a thin Python client in OmniMemEval's
`scripts/client_factory` registry. The client is an adapter, not a second NMG
implementation. It forwards:

- `add(...)` to session/history ingestion and memory extraction;
- `search(...)` to budgeted NMG recall and returns plain-text context;
- cleanup to deletion of the benchmark user's isolated namespace.

The adapter should call a stable local NMG HTTP or CLI boundary. It must not
reach into SQLite tables, duplicate graph logic in Python, or make benchmark
semantics part of NMG core.

## Migration gate

Before adopting OmniMemEval results as authoritative:

1. use the same fixed LongMemEval question IDs as the current matched run;
2. use the same reader and judge configuration;
3. compare answer score, evidence recall, token injection and latency;
4. verify per-user isolation and cleanup;
5. verify that every returned memory remains traceable to NMG evidence.

Until parity passes, the existing TypeScript runners remain local migration
fixtures. Afterwards they should shrink to fast deterministic regression tests.

## Deliberate non-goals

- Do not vendor OmniMemEval into NMG core.
- Do not maintain five separate NMG benchmark adapters.
- Do not adopt the heavier AgentBench/OpenClaw agent-memory track for Pi.
- Do not add another embedding or storage implementation solely for the
  harness; it must exercise the same NMG configuration used by Pi.
